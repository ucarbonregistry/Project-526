Dodson – Lindblom Hydro Power Private Limiteds Modification and
retrofitting of the existing 34 MW hydropower plant at Bhandardara -2
(project activity) in Maharashtra state in India by Dodson – Lindblom
Hydro Power Private Limited (DLHPPL) (hereafter called “the project”) at
Bhandardara, Akola Taluk, Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra state, India. The Bhandardara Power House No.2 (BH-2) is part of the Upper Pravara
River Basin Water Management System. River Pravara is a tributary of
river Godavari. It is located at a latitude of 19°33’15”N and longitude of
73°45’0”E. The Bhandardara Power House No.2 (BH-2) was operated and
maintained by Government of Maharashtra Water Resources Department
(GOMWRD). BH-2 draws its water from a small reservoir formed by
Randha Weir and has been operating intermittently since 1999. BH-2 was
designed to operate as a peaking station, but has essentially been
operating as a base-load station at approximately 50% of its rated
capacity. Severe limitations resulting from irrigation release criteria, lack
of availability of a balancing storage mechanism, technical limitations and
financial constraints affected normal operations of this facility as
originally envisioned by GOMWRD and have significantly impaired the
operation of BH-2. Hence the Government of Maharashtra decided to
privatise the operation of the BH-2 plant on a lease, own, operate and
transfer basis to Dodson Lindblom Hydro Power Private Limited
(DLHPPL). The existing BH-2 project uses a 34 MW vertical Francis type turbine,
which was previously damaged and is currently operating through
temporary repairs. DLHPPL as a project activity will completely overhaul,
rehabilitate and modernise the plant. The rehabilitation measures will
include complete automation of the plant. The rehabilitation and
automation of BH-2 would result in increased generation.

The Upper Pravara River Basin Water Management System envisions a comprehensive development of the
water resource potential of the area and includes several multi purpose dams and reservoirs. The system is
currently operated and maintained by Government of Maharashtra Water Resources Department, hereinafter
referred to as GOMWRD. Several key elements of the system are already in place and others are being
implemented or are slated for construction in the near future. The scheme involves the following major
elements:
¾ Bhandardara dam, is one of the oldest masonry gravity dams. The water released for irrigation could be fully
utilized by power houses further downstream and currently the irrigation releases are controlled from this dam;
¾ Bhandardara Power House No. 1 (BH-1): draws its water from the Bhandardara reservoir and is a single
hydro generating station of 12 MW;
¾ Bhandardara Power House No. 2 (BH-2): is 10 KM downstream from BH-1 and draws its water from a small
reservoir formed by Randha Weir; and
¾ Nilwande Dam: is 20 KM downstream from BH-2 and will collect the water released for irrigation from
Bhandhardara reservoir as well as the run off water from the catchment area between Bhandaradara Reservoir
and Nilwande. This dam is currently under construction. Once this dam is partially constructed, it could be
used to control irrigation releases to the downstream command area. This dam will include intake facilities to
feed a powerhouse and irrigation areas.
BH-2 has been operating intermittently since year 1999 and uses water discharged from both BH-1 and directly
from the Bhandhardara dam. BH-2 was designed to operate as a peaking station, but has essentially been
operating as a base-load station at approximately 50% of its rated capacity. Severe limitations resulting from
irrigation release criteria and the lack of availability of a balancing storage mechanism have significantly
impaired the operation of BH-2 as originally envisioned by GOMWRD. These restrictions have forced
GOMWRD to operate the project whenever possible barely at its technical limits. In addition, several technical
problems at the plant over the years have further affected normal operations of this facility.
Lack of funds with the GOMWRD have limited their ability to partially construct the required downstream
balancing storage facility as well as to make the necessary improvements in a timely and technically requisite
manner to allow proper operations of the BH-2 plant. The Government of Maharashtra decided to privatize the
operation of the BH-2 plant on a lease, own, operate and transfer basis. It is envisaged that the funds received
from this effort would be utilized to fund the construction of the balancing storage facility that would permit
the efficient utilization of scarce water resources in the region. The rehabilitation and operation of BH-2 was
awarded on a lease, own, operate and transfer basis to Dodson Lindblom Hydro Power Private Limited
(DLHPPL) on December 31, 2004.
